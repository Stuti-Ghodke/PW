# Q1
Statistics is the process of collecting,organising and analysing the data

# Q2
1.Descriptive
Organise and summarize the collected data.
Used when we need to make a conclusion of a sample data.

2.Inferential
Draw a conclusion from the collected and organised data.
Used when we need to make an inference about the population on basis of analaysed sample data.

# Q3

1.Quantitative--Numeric Data
They are of two types-:
    a.Discrete
    Example-No of family members,No of cars in a parking
    b.Continuous
    Example-Height,Weight,Distance,Speed
2.Qualitative--Categorical Data
They are of two types-:
    a.Nominal
    Example-Gender,Marital Status
    b.Ordinal
    Example-Temperature,Class Merit List

# Q4

1.Qualitative--Ordinal
2.Qualitative--Nominal
3.Quantitative--Continuous
4.Quantitative--Discrete


# Q5

1.Nominal Scale Data
  Categorical Data Variable
  Order doesn't matter
  Example-Gender,Colours
2.Ordinal Scale Data
  Ranking and Order matter
  Difference cannot be measured
  Example-Graduation
3.Ratio Scale Data
  Rank and order matter
  Difference can be measured including ratio
  Example-Grades
4.Interval Scale Data
  Rank and order matter
  Difference can be measured(excluding ratio)
  Does not have '0' starting value
  Example-Temperature

# Q6

    With the understanding of level of measurement we can easily analyse data on the bassis of data type.

# Q7

In Nominal data type the rank and order of data does not matter.
Whereas in ordinal data the rank and order matters.

# Q8

Histogram

# Q9

Descriptive data gives summary of data whereas inferential statistics helps us draw results from a set of data.

# Q10

Measures of Central Tendency-:
    1.Mean
    Average of the data
    2.Mode
    Quanitity appearing maximum number of times
    3.Median
    Middle element of sorted data
Measures of Dispersion-:
    1.Variance
    Spread of data
    2.Standard Deviation
    Deviation of data from mean value
